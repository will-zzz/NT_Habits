# TaskHack

A gamified to-do app intended for the [Neo Tokyo](https://neotokyo.codes/) community. Built Summer 2023 and deployed Summer 2024.

I came up with the idea for this project in the midst of physical therapy for my shoulders. I needed to not only incentivize exercising and stretching them every day, but make it fun and engaging.

Featuring a video game character that "levels up" and collects cool new items and pets, the app rewards users for completing self-set tasks every day and chastises them for not.

It also lets the user create "quests," such as key life achievements and milestones: running a marathon, launching a business, and even getting a pilot's license to name a few. These things take discipline and commitment, and this app can help guide the user to success.
### What happened to TaskHack?

Ironically, working on a productivity app every day kicked me into high gear and made me more productive. I focused on getting better, and over time my shoulders healed, so I stopped working on the app. Therefore, the demo does not include any on-chain items yet but can still be used as a goal setter and habit tracker.

Also, I sold the NFT... so I couldn't exactly build it with Web3 support as planned.
